# 📋 Task Manager (Frontend Only)

A simple task management web application built using **HTML**, **CSS/SCSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to view, add, and manage tasks with additional features like calendar view, user profile, and performance tracking (karma points). It uses **ApexCharts** for chart-based visualizations.
